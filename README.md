# Netflix Data Mining
An EDA which harvests Netflix's video catalog data regarding shows and movies. All related information such as IMDb reviews, runtime, season length, etc. are explored for correlation.
Measurements of center and distribution provide insight into improvements Netflix can enact for profit growth and customer retention.

Research Questions:
1. Whats the average season length? Does this change over time or by genre?
2. Does runtime vary between genres or video type (movie & show)?
3. How fast are videos being released, and is that yearly trend a constant increase? How many are allocated to each genre?
4. For shows: is imdb score correlated to seasons or runtime?
5. For movies: is imdb score correlated to runtime?
6. Is imdb score correlated to genres or age certification?

Key Insights:
1. Customers with a wider demographic of video genres will pass by videos easier, causing unnoticed videos.
2. Top-ranking video genres require marketing so new content stands out from the older catalog.
